# Overview
My goal in writing this program is to further my own understanding of the JavaScript language by researching and applying various uses, functions, and libraries found within.

My software is a basic JavaScript tutorial that showcases and demonstrates the manipulation of ES6 arrays, strings (with the help of the Voca library), and recursive functions. Users are meant to run the whole program first and foremost, and then follow along with the code and comments alongside the output. The Node.js feature allows said output to be displayed and read without the use of a web browser, as is typical with most JavaScript code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

To create my software, I used Visual Studio Code along with the Node.js runtime environment so that I could create, run, and output JavaScript programs using only Visual Studio Code.

I used JavaScript primarily, but with the addition of the Voca library in order to demonstrate its means of string manipulation.

# Future Work

- In the comments for the recursion portion, I mentioned the possibility of using advanced Paralellism and Concurrency techniques to make the timer function actually serve as an accurate countdown timer. This would be an interesting feature to add or demonstrate should the need arise.
- Demonstrate more string manipulation funcitons included in the Voca library
- Demonstrate more array manipulation functions found in ES6.
